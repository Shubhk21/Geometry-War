# Geometry-War

Simple game made using **C++ (SFML)** which uses **ECS game architecture** built from scratch. Give it a try and let me know if any updates are needed.

---

## Features
- Built in **C++** using the **SFML** library for graphics and window handling.
- Implements a custom **ECS (Entity-Component-System)** architecture—designed from the ground up.
- Lightweight and modular code structure—great for learning game architecture principles.

---

## Files
*(You can list key source files here, such as: `main.cpp`, `Game.cpp`, components, systems, etc.)*

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up **SFML** in your development environment (e.g., link against SFML’s graphics, window, and system modules).
3. Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler or build system.
4. Run the resulting executable to launch the game.

## About
This project demonstrates how to architect a simple game using modern patterns—combining multimedia rendering with clean, scalable code design. It’s ideal for developers looking to understand how ECS can structure game logic clearly and flexibly.

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Add **README with build instructions** specific to Visual Studio, CMake, or Makefiles.
- Implement **visual debugging** for entity systems (e.g., drawing bounding boxes).
- Make the project modular enough to serve as a **starting template** for 2D game prototypes.
